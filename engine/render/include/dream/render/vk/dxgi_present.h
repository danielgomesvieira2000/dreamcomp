// Windows presentation through a DXGI flip-model swapchain (dreamcomp).
//
// Some Vulkan drivers on Windows (Intel's, measured on Iris Xe) present every swapchain, windowed
// or borderless fullscreen, through a compositor copy ("Composed: Copy with GPU GDI" in PresentMon),
// about one refresh slower than a flip. A D3D11 flip-model swapchain on the same window gets
// "Hardware Composed: Independent Flip". So Vulkan keeps rendering, into textures shared with a
// D3D11 device on the same GPU, and D3D11 copies the finished image into its back buffer and
// presents. Access to each shared texture alternates through its keyed mutex: Vulkan takes key 0
// and hands over key 1 when it submits, D3D11 takes key 1 and hands back key 0 after the copy.
//
// Window owns one and uses it in place of a VkSwapchainKHR when it initialises; nothing outside
// Window sees the difference. On other platforms create() always fails.

    //            panel shows the previous one once more, instead of queueing behind it -- a late
    //            frame costs one repeat rather than a refresh of latency from then on (unchecked,
    //            the queue filled and stayed full: 52-58 ms). The depth adapts: one frame waiting
    //            while frames arrive on time, one more (up to three) whenever skips come often (a
    //            slow or battery-powered machine, where emulating a frame can take longer than a
    //            refresh), retrying one less after 10 s, backing off to 4 min while that keeps
    //            failing. The default; the caller paces.
    //   Latest:  sync interval 0 without tearing (mailbox). On Intel's driver this dropped about
    //            one frame a second even with perfectly regular presents (the replaced frames
    //            show as "Hardware: Independent Flip" in PresentMon); kept for comparison.
