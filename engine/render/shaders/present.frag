// The guest's own framebuffer, decoded to RGBA and uploaded. Whatever put the pixels there, a
// render or a direct write by the title, they arrive here the same way.
//
// When the image is larger than the area it is drawn into -- which is every run with --scale above
// 1 -- each output pixel covers several source pixels, and this averages all of them. Picking one
// and discarding the rest is what a plain nearest-neighbour sampler does, and it throws away the
// entire point of drawing at a higher resolution: supersampling only becomes anti-aliasing at the
// moment the extra samples are averaged. Sparse sampling of a detailed image is also what makes
// fine detail crawl and sparkle while the camera moves.
//
// Magnification is left alone: `taps` falls to 1 and the sampler's own filter decides, so the
// guest's pixels are still shown as pixels unless Presenter::smooth asks otherwise.
