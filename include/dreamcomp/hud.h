// Widescreen HUD correction with per-element overrides (docs/HUD.md).
//
// With a widened picture, the 2D HUD is found in each frame's display list (PortInfo::HudRule) and
// moved back to its 4:3 proportions, each element anchored to the left edge, the right edge or
// the centre. Overrides fix what the heuristic gets wrong: a rectangle in the console's 640x480
// coordinates (before any correction, so it holds at every window shape), the texture words of
// the element's pieces, and the anchor to use. A piece whose centre lies in the rectangle and
// whose texture is listed is forced into the HUD with that anchor -- or left stretched -- which is
// also how a 2D element the heuristic missed is added. The F1 editor (src/frontend/hud_editor.cpp)
// shows the result and edits the overrides; tools/hud_promote.py moves a player's saved file into
// the port.
